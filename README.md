This is a template that I have made using both Raylib and Flecs libraries using the bake compiler.

Please note that neither Raylib (https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) nor Flecs (https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/tree/master) belong to me. I have only created this template for ease-of-use for any developers who desire to start using Flecs and Raylib.
